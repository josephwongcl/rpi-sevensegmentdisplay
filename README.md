== About Me

At this time of writing I'm currently an Interactive Developer at Digiflare Inc. working heavily on the Android stack for both handhelds and tablets. On my free time I enjoy developing mobile applications and lightweight circuitry on my Raspberry Pi.

You can find more about me at http://inajstudios.com (If I ever get around to finishing it).
